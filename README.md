# Recursive Linked List in Python

This project implements a basic singly linked list in Python with recursive methods for summing node values, reversing the list, and searching for a value. It also includes iterative methods for inserting at the front or end of the list and displaying its contents.

## Features

- Insert nodes at the **front** or **end** of the list
- **Recursively sum** all node values
- **Recursively reverse** the linked list
- **Recursively search** for a value in the list
- Display the list in a readable format

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or just a terminal and text editor)

### Output Interpretation
* **Display Output**: Shows the current state of the list with arrows `(->)` connecting node values.
* **Sum Output**: Prints the total sum of all node values using recursion.
* **Search Output**: Returns `True` if the target value is found, otherwise `False`
* **After Reversing**: The list order is reversed recursively and printed with `.display()`.
